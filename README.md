- Learning as I go
- Please be gentle :c

## Contributing
Currently this is a school project, but feel free to look around! 
I probably won't accept contributions during active development (this is a school project, and I am being graded for this), but if you happen to stumble across this and go "hey, this is cool", feel free to pull!
