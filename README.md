# CLOVER-website - Company Website

## About
This is a website for our company! This project is actively maintained between December 2025 and June 2026 (dates subject to change). If you're here after those dates, this website is deprecated and no longer in use.

## Disclaimer
**Heads up:** This is my first major project! 
The content inside will also not be translated to English, everything inside is in Slovak (although I am sure Google Translate will not fumble too bad at it)
- Susceptible to vibe coding (but I try my best)
- Sometimes I'm just stupid
- Learning as I go
- Please be gentle :c

## Tech Stuff
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, light JavaScript
- **License:** MIT (because it seemed reasonable)
- **Status:** Active development
- **Experience Level:** Beginner-friendly code (probably)

## Project Details
This is a part of an educational program for [JA Slovensko](https://www.jaslovensko.sk) within Applied Economics (Aplikovaná Ekonomika), which is based on the acquisition of practical experience and skills. It is a learning-by-doing program for students between the ages of 17 and 19. This website is for the student firm pillar, where under the guidance of a teacher and a consultant, they establish student companies that simulate the activities of joint-stock companies. The company itself is not a fictitious matter, students work with real money and offer real products and services.

Our class at [SSŠ Štúrovo](https://sss-sturovo.edupage.org) for the year 2025/2026 decided that they want to host a website, and me, having dabbled a little in HTML and CSS coding decided to offer myself up for the task. You'll probably spot me in there among the pages!

## Contributing
Currently this is a school project, but feel free to look around! 
I probably won't accept contributions during active development (this is a school project, and I am being graded for this), but if you happen to stumble across this and go "hey, this is cool", feel free to pull!
